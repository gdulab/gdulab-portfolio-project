            <div className={styles.description}>
                <p>Hello! I'm Bart≈Çomiej Gdula, a Frontend Developer. My passion for programming began at the age of 14 when I had my first encounter with this fascinating world. I started my career working as an IT support, where I gained valuable experience in troubleshooting technical issues and assisting users.</p>
                <p>Over time, my dedication and skills were recognized, leading to a promotion as a project coordinator. However, as I observed the work of programmers around me, I realized that the process of software development truly captivated me, and I decided to fully immerse myself in this field.</p>
                <p>Apart from the world of technology, I indulge in the passion of music creation. I sing and play the guitar, piano, and bass guitar. Music serves as a unique way for me to express emotions and unwind after a busy day of work.</p>
                <p>During my free time, I also enjoy diving into the realm of board games, which provide me with entertainment and joy in the company of friends. Additionally, I explore the amazing universe of World of Warcraft, where I can immerse myself in adventures and encounter fantastic creatures within the game's universe.</p>
                <p>On this website, you'll find my programming portfolio and samples of my musical creations. I encourage you to explore my work and join me in discovering the countless possibilities offered by the worlds of programming and music.</p>
                <p>If you have any questions or would like to collaborate, feel free to get in touch. I look forward to sharing my passion and creating something exceptional together!</p>
